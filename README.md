**My DevOps Journey: 100 Projects in 24 Weeks**

As a self-learning DevOps engineer, I am embarking on a mission to complete 100 hands-on projects in **24 weeks**. These projects are designed to explore a wide range of topics in the DevOps ecosystem, offering practical experience and real-world insights into the challenges and solutions that define the field.

**Key Focus Areas**

**Automated Deployment*: Mastering techniques to streamline and automate application deployments, ensuring speed, reliability, and minimal downtime.

**Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):* Building and managing robust CI/CD pipelines to automate code testing and deployment processes seamlessly.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):* Leveraging tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to define and manage infrastructure programmatically, ensuring consistency and scalability.

**Monitoring & Logging:* Implementing solutions to monitor application performance and gather logs for efficient troubleshooting and optimization.

**Security & Compliance:* Integrating security best practices into workflows to protect applications and meet compliance standards.

**Scalability & Performance Optimization:* Developing strategies to scale applications effectively and optimize performance for growing workloads.

This initiative is not just a learning exercise; it's a commitment to immerse myself in real-world DevOps challenges and deliver solutions that are both functional and future-ready.
